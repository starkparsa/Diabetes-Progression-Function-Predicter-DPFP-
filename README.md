# Diabetes-Progression-Function-Predicter-DPFP

- Developed regression models using Random Forest and XG Boost to predict the
Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Introduced
in 1993, the DPF assesses genetic risk based on family history and calculates a score
indicating the likelihood of developing diabetes.
- Utilized feature engineering and imputation techniques to handle missing data and
enhance model performance.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE). XG
Boost emerged as the preferred model, achieving a lower MAE of 0.2416 compared to
Random Forest (0.2536), thereby demonstrating superior predictive accuracy.
